/* Four friends named Owen,Hannah,Trina, and Emily take walking very seriously and love to meet their step goals. They have a daily goal of 10,000 to 12,000 steps.
They decided to challege each other and record their daily steps to see who would end up with the most steps in a day, and overall steps during the week.
