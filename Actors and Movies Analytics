/* I created two tables, one with actors and their birth year and the other with famous movies they were in and their release year. 
First, I created a query and used and inner join to display the actors name and the movie they were in. My next query calculated the 
actors' age using their birth year, My final query used another JOIN to calculate the age the actor was when they starred in that movie.*/
